## etsy_data

### Getting Started
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository.
- Clone your fork to your local machine: `$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/etsy_data.git`
- Change Directory into the newly cloned etsy_data project: `$ cd etsy_data`
- Open the project in your favorite text editor, and begin editing the .js files.
- You must open your `index.html` file in Chrome, and use the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) to see your code running in the Console tab.
  - Remember to refresh the browser whenever you make a change to your codebase.

### Description
- There are (currently) 6 `.js` files that are prefixed by a number (i.e. 1-average.js) that each contain a unique problem.
- Each problem will require you to iterate over the `data` array (created in data.js) using different methods for different problems.
- When you solve the problem, the browser will display your answer.

### Objective
- To reinforce your understanding of the various Array methods that are commonly used when dealing with data.

### Resources
I have linked several   resources in the relevant `.js` files as well.
